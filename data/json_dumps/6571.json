There’s no better way to cool off during the steamy summer months than splashing about in Kenting’s crystal-clear waters for the day. \n\nAt Kenting National Park, you’ll find all kinds of activities to suit the outdoors-loving soul in you.

Kenting’s popularity has grown in recent years, so expect to be battling it out for space and photo opportunities along the beach. If you’d like to avoid the crowds, you can try heading to more secluded beaches such as Baisha Beach or Nanwan Beach.  \n\nDo note that June to October is Taiwan’s typhoon season, and the beaches might be closed when the waves are too strong. \n ","type":"text","id":33174},{"text":"2.\tFeast on summer fruits at a night market","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":33175},{"type":"image","url":"https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2015/08/06/07/16/life-877474_960_720.jpg","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"Pixabay ","source_url":"https://pixabay.com/en/photos/night%20market/","caption":"The fresh summer fruits make for a great treat","id":33216},{"text":"You might hate Taiwan’s summer weather with a vengeance, but guess who’s loving it?

All these fruits are sugary-sweet and have a high water content, so they’re perfect during summer. If you’re not keen on just the fruit itself, Taiwan’s night markets and shops have a whole host of ways to serve them. Try out icy smoothies of 木瓜牛奶 (papaya milk) or 香蕉牛奶 (banana milk). For the ultimate fruity cool down, try a mango shaved ice. This dessert comes with soft, fluffy flakes of mango ice and a generous dollop of mango, topped with a scoop of mango ice cream.

The Chinese believe that during the seventh lunar month, the gates of Hell are opened, and a whole host of hungry ghosts and ancestors come into the world of the living. You’ll see food laid out on roadsides, and opera performances with the front rows left empty for ghostly patrons to sit. Creeped out yet? Don’t be. Just don’t get between the ghosts and their food and you should be fine. \n\nWhile the usual Ghost Month festivities can be observed anywhere in Taiwan, the city of Keelung, to the north-east of Taipei, has a special take on it. Being a harbor city, Keelung has no shortage of drowned souls. To help guide them to land, water lanterns are lit and sent down the city’s rivers. It creates a scene that is both eerie and spiritual at once. The water lanterns are released on the fifteenth day of the lunar month, which varies from year to year. \n ","type":"text","id":33178},{"text":"4.\tGo for a soak at a hot spring in Xinbeitou ","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":33179},{"type":"image","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Beitou_Park.jpg","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"Wikimedia Commons ","source_url":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beitou_Park.jpg","caption":"Hot spring water runs through Xinbeitou, creating a beautiful, steamy river","id":33230},{"text":"Before you balk at the idea of soaking in a hot spring in hot weather, there are a few things you should consider.

So you can soak in a hot pool, and then end off in a cold pool, which will leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on the heat again. Moving between pools of different temperature is supposed to be good for circulation, and has the added benefit of making sure you don’t overheat. \n\nXinbeitou is just a twenty-minute train ride away from Taipei Main Station, and once you get there you’ll be assailed with choices. Nearly every resort or hotel there has their own private hot spring, which you can book on an hourly basis. You can also opt for the public hot spring, which is frequented by locals and is a much, much cheaper option. \n\nDo note that some of the hotel hot springs don’t allow clothes or swimwear, so be sure to ask beforehand if you’re not comfortable with that! Also, take precautions when using the hot springs – bring water to make sure you’re not dehydrated, don’t soak for too long, and if you feel ill, leave the water.

One of the main activities for locals is fishing, and the island is full beautiful, untouched nature for you to explore. You will have to pay about 120 TWD (3 USD) for a ticket to visit the three nature sites on the island. \n\nYou can walk along the nature trails – some of them wind through old banyan groves and coral caves, creating the feeling that you are walking through a trench. Surrounded by coral reefs, Xiao Liu Qiu is great for snorkeling or swimming. You can look at natural oddities such as the Flower Vase Rock, or just admire the corals. Remember to bring some protection for your feet – corals are sharp! \n\nXiao Liu Qiu is a great place to spend the weekend reconnecting with nature. Chill out on small secluded beaches and keep a look out for green sea turtles that frequent the coral reefs.

They work via an unmanned rental system – you just have to swipe your EasyCard. After you’re done, you can return the bike to any one of the YouBike stations throughout the city, and swipe your card again. \n\nYou’ll have to register your EasyCard to use the YouBike system, and you will also need a Taiwan cell phone number.

Along the way, you’ll pass by rural Taipei and city parks galore. The trail ends at Shalun Beach. The best part about cycling in Taipei is that if you get tired at any point, you can stop and take the MRT back. Do note that there aren’t YouBike Stations in Danshui, so you’ll have to take your YouBike on the MRT with you.

You write your wishes on a lantern and send it up to the sky. Typically, this is done during the lantern festival in Pingxi, but thanks to the growing popularity, you can do it any time. \n\nTo do this, you have to head to Shifen, a town in Pingxi District. You can get there via the railway from Taipei Main Station (you will have to change trains at Ruifang Station). Shifen is a cute little tourist trap – two streets of shops with a railway running between them. The shops sell a variety of food, souvenirs, and most importantly – lanterns. There are many, many shops selling paper lanterns. There will be painting stands set up along the tracks, with calligraphy brushes and ink for you to write your wishes. You can also choose different color combinations for your lantern – different colors signify different aspects of your life. Pink represents love, red represents health and so on. \n\nAfter that, the shopkeepers will help you light your lantern and snap pictures of you holding it, and then it’s time to send your good wishes into the sky! Whether you believe in it or not, it’s still a fun thing to do, and a nice way to think about what you want in life. For the best shots, go around evening, just as the sun is setting. \n\nAnother quirky thing about Shifen is that the railway is uncovered – anyone can step on it. In fact, you’re actively encouraged to stand on the tracks to release your lantern or set off fireworks. It’s a funny sight to watch everyone scramble out of the way as the train arrives.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the area, join a tour that will let you fly a Sky Lantern and enjoy the spectacular view of the area. The tour lets you explore and discover Taiwan's heritage with a visit to the coal-mining town of Pingxi, walk down Shifen Old Street and witness the spectacle that is Shifen Waterfall.\n\n\u003e #### 5-Hour Shifen Old Street Walk and Pingxi Sky Lantern Tour from Taipei\n\u003e\n\u003e **Duration**: Approximately 5 hours\n\u003e\n\u003e **Price**: From USD 52\n\u003e \n\u003e [Viator](https://www.viator.com/tours/Taipei/5-Hour-Pingxi-Sky-Lantern-Experience-and-Old-Street-Walk-Tour-from-Taipei/d5262-3071P32)","type":"text","id":33186},{"text":"8.\tOgle at the range of products in Taiwan’s 7-11s","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":33187},{"type":"image","url":"https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1497787_10202639389016236_898219016_n.jpg?oh=9519bc6c8e2c0b2e6bd3a7291c7427c5\u0026oe=5799B01F","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"Belicia Teo ","source_url":"https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1497787_10202639389016236_898219016_n.jpg?oh=9519bc6c8e2c0b2e6bd3a7291c7427c5\u0026oe=5799B01F","caption":"Taiwan's 7-11's sell everything from underwear to piping hot tea eggs ","id":33237},{"text":"‘Convenience’ takes on a whole new meaning in Taiwan’s 7-11s.

You can also buy an all-day Sun Moon Lake bus pass. \n\nOf course, the main pull of Sun Moon Lake is the lake itself. It looks nice by day, but the magic really happens at dawn or sunset. The best way to catch those views is to book yourself a hotel along the lake. The views will be worth it. \n\nDon't want to miss anything? Check out this 1-day tour that lets you explore the Sun Moon Lake Area, which includes the lake, Shueili River, Puli, Jhuoshuei River and Jiji.\n\n\u003e #### Sun Moon Lake 1-Day Leisure Tour from Taipei\n\u003e\n\u003e **Duration**: 1 day\n\u003e\n\u003e **Price**: From 150 USD\n\u003e\n\u003e [Viator](https://www.viator.com/tours/Taipei/Sun-Moon-Lake-1-Day-Leisure-Tour-from-Taipei/d5262-6279P16?eap=lonelyplanet-main-6296\u0026aid=vba6296en2)","type":"text","id":33200},{"text":"15.\tWatch a dragon boat race in Taipei ","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":33201},{"type":"image","url":"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4050/4719167155_5cdd2fb384_z.jpg","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"Julius Reque ","source_url":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/juliusreque/4719167155","caption":"Dragon boat races are full of adrenaline and excitement ","id":33281},{"text":"The Dragon Boat Festival, like most Chinese Festivals, has a rather tragic backstory. According to legend, when his state was captured by the Qin State, the Chinese poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by throwing himself into Miluo River. Distraught, his followers jumped into their boats to save him, or at the very least find his body. They also wrapped rice dumplings in leaves and dropped them into the river to keep the fish from eating his body. \n\nToday, dragon boat races are held throughout Asia, and zongzi, the sticky rice dumplings, are eaten as a traditional snack. Dragon boat racing has become an international sporting event, with teams from all over the world coming to Taiwan to compete. It’s an exciting, intense event and one that definitely shouldn’t be missed. The dragon boat races take place on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, so the date will vary from year to year. The races are held throughout the country, so you’ll most likely be able to catch one no matter where you are. Rice dumplings are sold at roadside stalls in the weeks leading up to the festival – you can spread the many different kinds of dumplings over different days and eat your fill.

The National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium is divided into three different areas. It has the Waters of the World, the Waters of Taiwan, and the Coral Kingdom Pavilion. Indoor exhibitions let you escape the outdoor heat. Enjoy looking at a wide range of marine species like penguins and the beluga whales. \n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnf56A8l36u/?utm_source=ig_embed\u0026amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Although it's in the Formosa Boulevard MRT subway station, you almost feel as though you're in an art gallery. You'll be standing under the world's largest glass artwork. Watch the different hues of light filter down in a beautiful display. The station is cool inside and equally impressive outside. \n\nMore than 4,500 panels of glass depict Taiwan, the universe, and more. It arches high above you and is mesmerizing. Make sure to pass through on local adventures, or make a stop on the way to nearby parks to experience it. Go along at night and hear the laser light sounds. \n\n\u003e #### Dome of Light\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**:  Meilidaozhan, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","type":"text","id":661478},{"text":"Soak up that summer sun ","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":33445},{"text":"A summer getaway to Taiwan will offer you sides of the island that you never thought you'd see from a place famed for night markets and mountains.
