Beach-goers and people who want to escape city life take the ferry over, and most head back once it starts to get dark. However, around 10 pm, mobile carts of food and stoves descend near to the ferry pier and within minutes Cheung Chau’s very own mini night-market is formed. \n\nThere you can find all kinds of food, ranging from sushi and dessert soups to traditional Hong Kong street food. Visitors and locals alike will queue for the food. If the night market isn’t enough to keep you entertained, you can take a stroll along Peak Road and enjoy the silence and picturesque views. \n\nFerries return to Central at 11.45 pm and 2.20 am, so be sure not to miss it or you’ll be spending the night on Cheung Chau! Then again, the market lasts all night so that might not be a bad thing. \n\n\n","type":"text","id":31757},{"text":"14.\tGet a dose of art and culture at the Fringe Club (open till 3 am)","type":"heading","heading_type":"sub heading","id":31758},{"type":"image","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Fringe_Club_Arts_HK_People.jpg","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"Wikimedia Commons ","source_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Fringe_Club_Arts_HK_People.jpg","caption":"The Fringe Club ","id":31793},{"text":"If you consider yourself to be of the creative and artsy type, or just want a different kind of drinking scene, then go to the Fringe Club.

It has two bars that you can choose from, and one of them is on the building’s rooftop. \n\nThroughout the week, the club hosts a variety of performances, ranging from theatre performances to live music and book readings.

If you can, go on a Wednesday – it’s salsa night. The club has separate spaces, so it’s an ideal spot for chilling with friends or dancing the night away. \n\nUp for more drinks and dancing?
