Located on Yukawa River, shortly before the river discharges into the famous lake, Ryuzu Waterfall is so-named because it resembles the head of a dragon. The waterfall is surrounded by many trees which turn yellow and red during the autumn season, making it appear more like a fiery red dragon. Examine the fall carefully for yourself and see if you agree. Because of its shadowy location, this is one of the earliest spots to view autumn foliage in early October.\n\nThere is a small observation deck near a rest house where you can get panoramic views of the waterfall for free. Take a short rest here where you will find a food kiosk and souvenir shop. If time permits, you can even trek upstream for about 300 meters (984 feet) along a walking trail and enjoy more impressive views of the river gushing towards the lake. Do take extra caution as the trail may be slippery.\n\n\u003e #### Ryuzu Waterfall (竜頭ノ滝)\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**:  Chugushi, Nikko, Tochigi Prefecture \n\u003e\n\u003e **Price**: Free\n\u003e\n\u003e **Opening Hours**:  Always open\n\u003e\n\u003e **Access**: 10-minute bus ride from Chuzenji Onsen to Ryuzu no taki bus stop towards Yumoto Onsen (covered by the free pass)\n\u003e\n\u003e **Contact**: +81 288-22-1525\n","type":"text","id":84965},{"text":"Bonus: Take a short cruise along Lake Chuzenji","type":"heading","heading_type":"sub heading","id":84966},{"type":"image","url":"https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2016/05/07/05/22/japan-1377097_1280.jpg","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"ytani0323","source_url":"https://pixabay.com/en/japan-tochigi-lake-snow-1377097/","caption":"Lake Chuzenji","id":84967},{"text":"Depending on whether you are heading back to Asakusa or Shinjuku via Tobu Railways or Japan Rail, you may have some time left for a short cruise along Lake Chuzenji, after returning from Ryuzu Waterfall.
