Head Outdoors To Plage de la Grande Conque. Rated very highly in Cap-d'Agde, France, this beach is a unique black sand beach sitting on the Mediterranean coast.  One will be able to spot a cove which has been carved out by the sea into the volcanic rock, therefore making it a volcanic beach.  It is a beautiful beach, both when the weather is comfortable and wild. \r\n\r\n2. Archaeology museum, Musée de l’Éphèbe.  This underwater archaeology museum which opened in 1987 overlooks the beautiful harbour of Cap d’Agde and contain several modern galleries. This museum contains exhibits collection of items recovered from the seabed, arising from shipwrecks. A visit to the museum will illustrate how cultures formed in Cap-d'Agde and trading conducted. The name of the museum arises from one artifact, the l’Éphèbe d’Agde, which is a late-Hellenistic bronze statue, assumed to be that of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n3. Enjoy Luna Park As A Family. Luna Park or the Île des Loisirs  is situated in the centre of Cap d’Agde’s Luno Lagoon. It is an all age entertainment park catered to different types of recreation. The park includes several bars, restaurants and even a casino.  Luna park is essentially a funfair where entry is free and there are several rides for kids. If you have kids, head down to the park in the early evening so that they can enjoy riding on the carousels, jump around on the bouncy castles and slides. \r\n\r\n4. Amazing Experience At Cap d’Agde Naturist Village. Although not exactly a village in the actual sense, the Naturist Village is largely located by the sea. It is a vast fenced-off area and is easily accessible from the beach. The Naturist village is a self-contained town and has about 2,500 campsites, apartment complexes, hotel, several restaurants and so on. It is easy to spend the entire day at this resort. \r\n\r\n5. Spend A Day Whale Watching. Sail out into sea with  Terre Marine, a reputed tour company which organises trips out to sea. The office is located next to the information counter and reservations can be made at the office itself. While you enjoy your trip out at sea, you will also be able to enjoy the sight of whales and dolphins enjoying off the French coast. \r\n\r\n6. Visit A World Heritage Site. Take some time out to visit The Canal du Midi, which is a World Heritage Site. Get aboard a floating barge or stroll along the banks and enjoy the views of the canal. The 360km waterway links the Mediterranean with the Atlantic ocean featuring 328 structures. This remains one of the best engineering feats of the 17th century. \r\n\r\n7. Sip Wine At Hérault-Méditerranée. Cap d'Agde is known for its wine. Wine growing is indeed prevalent through the region. However, the best vineyard to perhaps enjoy the best of the region's wine would be the local villages of Hérault-Méditerranée. In fact, tourists to the region in the month of May can perhaps experience Vinocap, the largest open-air wine tourism exhibition held in South France. This exhibition is usually held Cap d'Agde's quayside on  the Ascension weekend, typically in the beginning of May.
