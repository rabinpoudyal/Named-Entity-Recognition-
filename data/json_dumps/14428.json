There are no high rises here, just a white, secluded sandy beach, a coral reef and warm waters rich in marine life, especially turtles. It is because of the abundance of turtles in the bay that makes snorkeling a must-do beach activity. Closeby are several natural and historic sites such as a lagoon, natural and ecological parks and Mayan ruins. Akumal is a perfect place to relax and do as little or as much as you wish. \n","summary_title":null,"summary_text":null,"article_id":174365,"original_article_id":null,"language":null,"is_published_version":false,"is_more_info_allowed":null,"slug":"draft-best-things-to-do-in-akumal-mexico","visited_period":null,"first_approved_at":"2017-07-19T17:02:00.000+08:00","published_at":"2019-01-23T11:08:00.000+08:00","created_at":"2017-04-01T16:58:49.000+08:00","updated_at":"2019-01-23T11:10:48.000+08:00","navigator_id":492,"user_id":513,"workflow_state":"published","article_type":"curated_article","content_type_new":"DG","hotel_id":null,"deleted_at":null,"region_id":6196,"visited_month":null,"visited_season":null,"proposal":"I.
