Oku Nikko is hence one of the most popular hot spring destinations in Japan, and it can be visited from Tokyo in less than 3 hours!\n\nOne of the recommended places to enjoy the Oku Nikko Hot Spring is Spa Village Kamaya. This affordable hotel is extremely popular among tourists and families. Many hot spring sites usually mix water with the natural hot spring for reasons like temperature regulation, but the hot spring at Spa Village Kamaya is 100% natural. The water is hence very rich in minerals and is said to provide healing abilities for a myriad of health issues. The open air hot spring at Spa Village Kamaya offers great views of the lush nature of the area.\n\nNot only that, Spa Village Kayama is well-known for fantastic Japanese style meals.
