Get a fishing license; this is something you should do to fish legally. You can easily obtain a license online from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. \r\n\r\nDuring the month of March, and from June to August, thousands of grunion come to the shores of San Diego at night to spawn. As long as you're at La Jolla, Mission Bay, or Del Mar, you can be assured of a good harvest. If you're in Coronado, wait a few days after the high tide mark to catch some silver strand from 11 pm onwards. \r\n\r\nFishing is a safe activity but requires of you some patience and skill. This is great for family bonding as well as a solo activity. Your catches for the night also make awesome, inexpensive souvenirs or gifts for your friends and family.
