León has a long history as a center of the leather industry, offering shoes, boots, belts, jackets, and other leather accessories not only in Mexico, but around the world. It has first-class services and hotels making it one of the most important cities in Mexico along with León's entertainment, restaurants, leisure activities, arts, and recreation. It is also considered one of the most environmentally friendly cities in Mexico and has a high number of cyclists, in part because of integrating a network of bike lanes into the public transportation system. In March 2012 it received an award as \"City Water Champion,\" due to great progress it has made in the areas of sanitation, wastewater reuse, and energy cogeneration from biogas.\n\nWhile much of León is industrial, it is also a great little authentic Mexican city. There is a nice, large pedestrian area in the center, which comes to life at night with street sellers, music, and Mexican families just enjoying their city.

León has a long history as a center of the leather industry, offering shoes, boots, belts, jackets, and other leather accessories not only in Mexico, but around the world. It has first-class services and hotels making it one of the most important cities in Mexico along with León's entertainment, restaurants, leisure activities, arts, and recreation. It is also considered one of the most environmentally friendly cities in Mexico and has a high number of cyclists, in part because of integrating a network of bike lanes into the public transportation system. In March 2012 it received an award as \"City Water Champion,\" due to great progress it has made in the areas of sanitation, wastewater reuse, and energy cogeneration from biogas.\n\nWhile much of León is industrial, it is also a great little authentic Mexican city. There is a nice, large pedestrian area in the center, which comes to life at night with street sellers, music, and Mexican families just enjoying their city. Also, León is a great place to escape if you're a budget traveler, unless you're in the market for a lot of leather.

I have been a traveler most of my life going back to my first trip to Europe when I was a junior in college. After that, I was hooked. Since then I have traveled in Western and Eastern Europe, Caribbean, China, Kenya, Tanzania, South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Cuba, Canada, Mexico and most of the US. I believe travel should be more than just “seeing the sites”, but a real emersion into local culture and history. I try to write from the perspective of “traveler” versus “tourist”.
