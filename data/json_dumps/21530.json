Overshadowed by more popular cities such as Bangkok and Hatyai, Dannok remained for many years as a quiet place one passed through from the Sadao Customs and Immigration. Recently, however, the town has shown slow but steady progress in making the place more tourist-friendly. \n\nDannok is a small town, perfect for a day trip from popular cities. If you're driving, park at the duty-free complex in Bukit Kayu Hitam and walk to the checkpoint. You won't have to take a tuk-tuk to get anywhere- everything is reachable on foot, but have sunblock and umbrellas at hand if you melt easily. Start your journey before noon and you'll be satisfied by night time. Here's a list of things to do while in this darling place for the day. \n","summary_title":null,"summary_text":null,"article_id":176575,"original_article_id":null,"language":null,"is_published_version":false,"is_more_info_allowed":null,"slug":"draft-things-to-do-in-dannok","visited_period":null,"first_approved_at":"2017-07-28T12:26:00.000+08:00","published_at":"2019-03-01T16:54:00.000+08:00","created_at":"2017-07-04T10:25:51.000+08:00","updated_at":"2019-03-01T16:57:30.000+08:00","navigator_id":604,"user_id":289,"workflow_state":"published","article_type":"curated_article","content_type_new":"DG","hotel_id":null,"deleted_at":null,"region_id":110075765,"visited_month":null,"visited_season":null,"proposal":"-go shopping in one of the many convenience stores (great deals on most products!)\r\n-sample the mango and durian rice as well as other street food\r\n-try a massage parlor\r\n-visit the Asian Cultural Village\r\n-visit the Wat Tham Khao Rup Chang (temple in a cave)\r\n-try the local restaurants (Ped Restaurant, Water View Restaurant)","have_good_pictures":null,"notes":null,"meta_description":"Here's a good guide for those of you needing a list of things to do with your day in Dannok, Thailand.

Overshadowed by more popular cities such as Bangkok and Hatyai, Dannok remained for many years as a quiet place one passed through from the Sadao Customs and Immigration.

You won't have to take a tuk-tuk to get anywhere- everything is reachable on foot, but have sunblock and umbrellas at hand if you melt easily. Start your journey before noon and you'll be satisfied by night time. Here's a list of things to do while in this darling place for the day.
