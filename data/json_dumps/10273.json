If you love okonomiyaki, a type of Japanese savoury grilled pancake with a variety of ingredients, you have to try monja-yaki when you visit Asakusa. Monja-yaki is similar to okonomiyaki but more water or dashi (cooking stock) is added to the batter so it appears runnier than its famous cousin. Those who love the texture of melted cheese will like monja-yaki very much because of the runnier bite.\n\nDuring World War II, food was scarce so people created this yummy monja-yaki dish with the easy mixture of flour and dashi. As writing materials were also hard to come by during the war, the grill became children’s chalkboard to practise writing in the watery batter mixture while the dish was being prepared. That is why monja-yaki has remained as a popular Japanese comfort food with the locals all this while as they reminisce about the old days. Monja-yaki may not be aesthetically pleasing because of its gluey texture, but you will not regret trying it.
