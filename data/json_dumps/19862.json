But very few have heard of or have actually visited Quy Nhon, a peaceful yet vibrant coastal city in central Vietnam. Usually considered by most as a stopover destination while traveling between Nha Trang and Danang (or Hoi An), this city has long remained hidden from the eyes of a majority of Vietnamese and foreign travelers. And this is precisely what makes it an obscure treasure. But growing information interchanged over the internet as well as relentless efforts by the Vietnamese government are putting this city on the traveler's map. \n\nWith the ability to become Vietnam's next big tourist destination, Quy Nhon can offer you endless hours of tranquility, beautifully entwined with sundry escapades and a simple, yet colorful culture. So are you ready to explore this city?

Snorkel and swim around Phuong Mai Peninsula","description":"Away from the main city and located on the other side of the Thi Nai Bridge, the longest oversea bridge in Vietnam, are the beaches of Phuong Mail Peninsula. On your way to one of the most frequented beaches ‘Nhon Ly’, you will come across Phuong Mai sand dunes which is a vast expanse of sand that keeps changing its shape due to the sea-winds blowing from the beaches. You can test your strength by trying to climb one of those dunes. It can be an arduous task, especially during summers. However, the final reward - breathtaking views of the endless sea merging into the horizon, is totally worth the effort.\n\nNear Nhon Ly lies the paradise beach of Ky Co that can be easily reached by a fishing boat or a speed boat from Nhon Ly fishing village. Stunning cliffs in the backdrop, white sand, warm sunlight, clear blue waters and small lagoons that have formed amidst small sea rocks - doesn’t it all appear to be a piece of an artist’s work? Well, that’s Ky Co for you! You can enjoy a swim or simply lie down on the soft sand here. There is also a small reef near Nhon Ly by the name of Bai Dua where one can snorkel and experience the world beneath the surface of the sea.\n\nEo Gio (Wind Waist) is another famous attraction of Nhon Ly which welcomes the tourists with tall cliffs, gusty winds and deep blue waters smashing against the bumpy rocks. Eo Gio which derived its name from its saddle shape, is a place for adventure lovers as bathing on this beach interwoven with large rocks and stone pebbles can be challenging. Nhon Ly commune has another fascinating tourist attraction ‘Hon Seo’ which is a pristine and uninhabited island that can be reached by a boat from Nhon Ly or Quy Nhon port. This island is a retreat with varieties of wild plants and birds as well as colorful rocks of numerous sizes which give it a unique look. Here you can set out on exploring the island by yourself or just camp and fish while enjoying this natural bliss.\n\nIf you travel a few kilometers north from Nhon Ly, you reach the Trung Luong Beach. This beach presents an eclectic blend of blue sea, sand dunes, pure air and rocks. It is a perfect destination to unwind and enjoy short romantic walks along the beach. This beach also offers a choice of grilled seafood that you can savor while imbibing the alluring sights. If you travel a few kilometers towards the end of the peninsula, you will reach Nhon Hai fishing village from where you can take a boat to the dry islet of Hon Kho. Hon Kho presents a harmonious combination of turquoise waters, sandy beach and coral reefs. The reef here lies close to the shore and is very shallow, thus can be easily explored even if one doesn’t know how to swim. Moreover, you can rent a life jacket and goggles from the local tour providers. Hon Kho also is a turtle conservation center too. If you get lucky, you may get a chance to see the turtles when they come to the shore to lay eggs at night.\n\u003e #### Ky Co\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**:  Bãi Kỳ Co, Nhơn Lý, Tp.
