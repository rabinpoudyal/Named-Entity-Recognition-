Travelling is a sublime event for her to remind herself to broaden the depths of her knowledge by visiting beautiful places, to making new friends, learning new cultures and languages, and getting in tune with nature. She hopes to continue to travel the roads less travelled and bring the wondrous world to readers through her sights and senses. She has dreams of having her own travel and dining show one day. Her favourite inspirational quote of all time is Abraham Lincoln's \"And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count, it's the life in your years.\"","career":"","achievement":"","title":"","company_name":"","profile_image_url":null,"picture_updated_at":"2017-03-06T10:20:44.000+08:00","picture_file_size":1784615,"picture_content_type":"image/jpeg","picture_file_name":"IMG_2689.JPG","twitter_id":"angelcwy","facebook_id":"Angel Cheryl","googleplus_id":"","website":"","reason_comment":null,"reject_comment":null,"disabled_at":null,"user_id":449,"created_at":"2017-03-01T15:22:45.000+08:00","updated_at":"2017-04-27T11:34:48.000+08:00","deleted_at":null,"slug":"cheryl","instagram_id":"angelcwy","recruited_by":"Marta","managed_by":"Marta","pinterest_id":"Angel Cheryl","tumblr_id":"","grade":null,"writing_in":null,"origin_city_region_id":null,"current_city_region_id":null},"hotel":null,"region":{"id":3124,"region_type":"City","relative_significance":"","sub_class":"","city_flg":1,"name":"Seoul","name_long":"Seoul, South Korea","parent_region_type":"Multi-City (Vicinity)","parent_name":"Seoul (and vicinity)","parent_name_long":"Seoul (and vicinity), South Korea","code":"seoul-3124","depth":4,"all_parent_ids":",6023099,94,178308,","image_url":"/world/region/3124_l.jpg","small_image_url":"/world/region/3124_m.jpg","thumbnail":"/world/region/3124_s.jpg","description":null,"search_distance":10000,"disp_order":0,"disp_flg":1,"del_flg":0,"created_at":"2014-11-12T04:26:10.000+08:00","updated_at":"2014-11-20T16:40:14.000+08:00","parent_region_id":178308}}}
