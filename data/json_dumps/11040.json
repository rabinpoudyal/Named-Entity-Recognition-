{"article":{"id":11040,"title":"10 Best Things To Do In Ko Lanta, Thailand","lead_paragraph":"Ko Lanta, also spelt as Koh Lanta, is a beautiful island off the southwestern coast of Thailand, part of the province of Krabi. Surrounded by the Andaman Sea, the warm clear waters lap up against the pristine white beaches where you can laze away a sunny day, before experiencing a fiery beachside nightlife scene that will have your hair standing on end. Average temperatures hover around 30 degrees C (86 F) and the area is thought to be one of the origins of the Thai people, with evidence dating back to the prehistoric period. Ko Lanta is a place to relax, where the words \"island life\" seem to resonate with ubiquity. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZ4A_UqTsss?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\u0026mute=1\u0026autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nRead on to find out about the best things to do in Ko Lanta, Thailand:","summary_title":null,"summary_text":null,"article_id":162740,"original_article_id":null,"language":null,"is_published_version":false,"is_more_info_allowed":null,"slug":"draft-things-to-do-ko-lanta","visited_period":null,"first_approved_at":"2017-06-29T15:23:00.000+08:00","published_at":"2018-06-19T11:51:00.000+08:00","created_at":"2017-02-10T22:33:33.000+08:00","updated_at":"2018-06-19T11:56:05.000+08:00","navigator_id":512,"user_id":238,"workflow_state":"published","article_type":"curated_article","content_type_new":"DG","hotel_id":null,"deleted_at":null,"region_id":6035252,"visited_month":null,"visited_season":null,"proposal":"Alternative title; A week in Ko Lanta?

No night time on Ko Lanta is complete without seeing somebody swallowing a fire stick and throwing it as high as he can to catch it between his legs. \r\n3. Rent a motorbike. Travel the island in half a day on a bike. But be careful, the roads are a lot worse than on the mainland so slow down to island life pace, take your time and drink it in. \r\n4. Boat trips. Operators of boat tours make up one in 3/4 shops along any main road. Boats to Koh Lipe, Phi Phi islands, Koh Rok, Ao Nang, wherever you want to go!\r\n5. Lanta animal welfare. A shelter for stray and sick animals on the island, visitors are encouraged to donate as well as help out with dog walking and playing with the cats. \r\n6. Beaches. So many beautiful beaches, in every area of the island. Enjoy a beachfront massage whilst watching the sunset from the best spot on the north west of the island. \r\n7. Lanta old town. Exactly what it sounds like. The old port and still the district capital. Temples, a pier and the chance to wander the old market.\r\n8. Koh Rok island and snorkelling. Clear blue water, coral reef and an abundance of fish. Beautiful beaches and warm seas make for a memorable day trip.

As in the rest of the country, Ko Lanta proudly hosts such markets everywhere. Perhaps the best of the markets is the night market in Baan Saladan on Wednesday evenings. Market stalls are open all day long, but the night market really gets going at around 4 pm and goes through until around 9 pm. An array of food, clothing, and souvenirs are available, at often very cheap prices. If you like to eat your street food from a skewer, you will very much enjoy this market. You'll find meat on a stick, fish on a stick, and deserts on a stick. In fact, if the vendors found a way to achieve it, I'm sure they'd sell massaman curry or pad Thai on a stick too. The clothing and souvenir stalls will be like many you have seen throughout Thailand if you have been elsewhere in this wondrous country. There's definitely something that will appeal to you here with all the numerous things to do and sights at the street markets.\n\n\n\u003e #### Traditional Street Market\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**:  Baan Saladan\n\u003e\n\u003e **Website**: [Baan Saladan market](http://www.kohlanta-thailand.com/baan-saladan/shopping.htm)\n\n\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\u003e #### Locations\n\u003e\n\u003e **Sunday Morning**:  Old Town central square\n\u003e\n\u003e **Monday**: Southern Haad Khlong Dao\n\u003e\n\u003e **Tuesday and Friday**:  East of Khlong Nin\n\u003e\n\u003e **Wednesday**:  Baan Saladan\n\u003e\n\u003e **Thursday**: Between Haad Phra Ae and Khlong Khong\n\u003e\n\u003e **Saturday**:  Haad Khlong Dao","type":"text","id":240792},{"text":"2.

It consists of many islands in the south of Krabi Province. Once on the main island, you can participate in water sports such as boating, scuba diving, and snorkeling. You can also hike through the islands through the mountainous terrain, rain forest, and beach forest. After an exciting, but perhaps exhausting tour of the park, you can lounge on one of the park's iconic beaches. The park is well known for its pristine beaches with impossibly blue waters and fine white sand, so you will definitely love your beach experience.\n\n\u003e #### Mu Ko Lanta National Park\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**: Mu Ko Lanta National Park, Moo 5, Tambon Ko Lanta Yai, Amphoe Ko Lanta, Krabi, 81150, Thailand\n\u003e\n\u003e **Website**: [Mu Ko Lanta National Park](https://www.thainationalparks.com/mu-ko-lanta-national-park)","type":"text","id":582485},{"text":"10.

The vibrant hammocks sold in this store are special. They are handmade by people of the Mlabri tribe of Thailand. Mlabri translates to “saved” because the tribe’s way of life was threatened by deforestations. The members were displaced and have sustained themselves by making and selling their quality, hand-woven hammocks. Not only can you get a beautiful, durable hammock but also, you can help the tribe prosper.\n\n\u003e #### Hammock House\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**: Ko Lanta Yai, Ko Lanta District, Krabi 81150, Thailand","type":"text","id":582498},{"text":"Island life","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":242190},{"text":"Ko Lanta, like so many islands around the world, enjoys that \"island life\" feel of a relaxed attitude and a slower pace of life. Lanta is often used as a stepping stone between the mainland and the other islands in the region, most often the hugely popular Phi Phi islands and I forbid you to look out onto those islands off in the distance without longing to go and explore them. I spent four days on Ko Lanta in April 2017 and endured (oh no, it wasn't tough) long hot days, relaxing on the beach and stormy nights with some of the loudest thunderstorms I have ever witnessed. Ko Lanta's biggest appeal is the picture perfect surroundings it enjoys, clear waters, and distant islands. Take a walk around the island at night and spot the fireflies lighting your way after witnessing a breathtaking sunset behind the islands dotted along the horizons.
