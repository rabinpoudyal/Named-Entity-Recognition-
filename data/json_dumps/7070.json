Birkenstock has a history dating back till the year 1774, yet their items will never go out of trend. You can still find Birkenstock products on the catwalks in 2016, and it’s definitely a fashionable brand. Not only is it trendy, but the shoes are super comfortable and easy to match with other items of clothing! It is a little pricey for a pair of sandals, but it’s a lot cheaper here in Germany than buying elsewhere. And besides, a pair of Birkenstocks can last you several years.
