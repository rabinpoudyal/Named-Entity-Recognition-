Go on a night hike in El Yunque","description":"https://www.facebook.com/elyunquerainforesttour/photos/a.1225706310885123.1073741908.126207827501649/1225707057551715/?type=3\u0026theater\nhttps://www.facebook.com/elyunquerainforesttour/photos/a.1225711074217980.1073741909.126207827501649/1225711420884612/?type=3\u0026theater\n\nThe organisms of the bioluminescent bays aren't the only living things that glow in the dark! If you take a night tour of El Yunque, you'll likely see some bioluminescent insects and mushrooms. A majority of the wildlife in El Yunque is nocturnal, so it's a whole different experience at night. The rainforest closes at 6:00 pm, so you have to join one of the tour groups for a night hike. Along the way, you'll likely learn about some of the plants and wildlife, like the coquí frogs, take in the night-views, and maybe even take a dip in Rio Mammies, a river swimming hole. These tours are only offered on certain days, at certain times, so be sure to check out their websites.\n\n\u003e #### Twilight Nature Walk to River Adventure with El Yunque Tours\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**: El Yunque Tours Office, Rio Grande, PR 00745\n\u003e\n\u003e **Website**: [Twilight Nature Walk to River Adventure](http://www.elyunquetours.com/project/twilight-nature-walk-river-adventure/)\n\n\u003e #### Magical Nights in El Yunque with AdvenTours\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**: El Yunque, Puerto Rico\n\u003e\n\u003e **Website**: [Magical Nights in El Yunque](http://www.adventourspr.com/east/elyunque/elyunquenighthikes.html)","activity":null,"images":[],"ignore_paragraph_images":[],"partner_link_last_message":null,"published_at":null,"embed":[{"type":"embeded","orig_url":"https://www.facebook.com/elyunquerainforesttour/photos/a.1225706310885123.1073741908.126207827501649/1225707057551715/?type=3\u0026theater","value_html":"OEmbed fetch flag has been disabled, enable it for HTML "},{"type":"embeded","orig_url":"https://www.facebook.com/elyunquerainforesttour/photos/a.1225711074217980.1073741909.126207827501649/1225711420884612/?type=3\u0026theater","value_html":"OEmbed fetch flag has been disabled, enable it for HTML "},{"type":"text","value":"The organisms of the bioluminescent bays aren't the only living things that glow in the dark!
