Instead of mixing all the ingredients together, they are layered. In addition, the amount of cabbage used in the Hiroshima version is usually three to four times the amount used in the Kansai-Osaka style.\n \nA great place to taste this famous local delicacy is none other than Okonomimura. Rated as the best in Japan for okonomiyaki, you can take your pick from the numerous okonomiyaki eateries housed on the second to fourth floors of the Okonomimura building.

With 6 rivers running through the prefecture and draining into Hiroshima Bay, carrying nutrients from the Chugoku Mountains, seafood caught in Hiroshima Bay are highly nutritious and boasts a rich flavour. In fact, Hiroshima is the top oyster-producing city in the country, accounting for over 60% of oyster production. So Hiroshima is definitely the best place to enjoy this delicacy.\n \nOyster lovers must visit Miyajima, a small island less than an hour outside the city of Hiroshima. Due to favourable water conditions around the island, the oysters found here are renowned for their above-average size, juiciness and tenderness. Make a trip down to the stylish Kaki-ya restaurant for its highly-acclaimed yet reasonably priced oyster dishes in Miyajima! The best way to sample Kaki-ya's line-up of oyster dishes is to order the \"Kaki-ya teishoku\". It is a set meal that includes 2 yaki-gaki (grilled oysters), small servings of kaki-furai (breaded and fried oysters), oysters pickled in oil, and kaki-meshi (oysters on rice).\n\n\n\u003e #### 牡蠣屋 Kaki-ya\n\u003e\n\u003e **Address**:  539, Miyajimacho, Hatsukaichi-shi, Hiroshima prefecture\n\u003e\n\u003e **Price**: from 19.50 USD \n\u003e\n\u003e **Opening Hours**:  10am - 6pm daily\n\u003e\n\u003e **Contact**:  +81 829-44-2747\n\u003e\n\u003e [Website](http://www.kaki-ya.jp/)","type":"text","id":57648},{"text":"3.\tAnago – nutritious saltwater eels so soft you don’t want to miss them","type":"heading","heading_type":"heading","id":57650},{"type":"image","url":"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4078/4760494022_bc08683df0_b.jpg","is_main_picture":false,"source_name":"Flickr","source_url":"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4078/4760494022_bc08683df0_b.jpg","caption":"Anago","id":57661},{"text":"Besides oysters, Anago is another seafood specialty of Hiroshima that you do not want to miss. Unagi, or river eel, may be the more preferred fish for its fatty flesh, but Anago, or saltwater eels, are definitely worth a try for its incredibly soft texture. It is less oily than its famed cousin, and feels really fluffy and soft when cooked!\n \nFor the best Anago dish, you must visit the family-run traditional restaurant – Ueno in Miyajima. Ueno has been serving wild Anago since 1901, more than a century ago. Its signature dish, the Anago-Meshi (grilled eel over rice) will make you fall in love with the nutritious sea eel.

This palatable dish is served with the noodles and broth in two different bowls, instead of mixing both together in one bowl. The boiled noodles are cooled with iced water and topped with vegetables like shredded green onion and boiled cabbage. Dip these cold noodles into the hot and spicy broth in the other bowl, which is a unique feature of Hiroshima Tsukemen. The degree of spiciness can be adjusted to suit your taste. You can also request for other toppings such as sliced roast pork and eggs to go along with the dish.\n \nFor a taste of the original Tsukemen, head to Bakudanya restaurant for a taste of the authentic local specialty. Challenge your tastebuds by trying out the different levels of spiciness ranging from 0 to 20 of this famous Tsukemen!
