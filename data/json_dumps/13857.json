It was later added, in 1916. In 1918, Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the creation of a republic from the balcony and in 1933, the Reichstag mysteriously caught on fire, destroying both the dome and the chamber, serving as an alleged reason for the Nazi regime to persecute political opponents.\n \nAfter being destroyed in the war, the building was rebuilt without a dome in the 1960s.
