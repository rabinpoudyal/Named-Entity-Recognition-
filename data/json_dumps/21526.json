Many have tried to put a finger on what exactly it is (including myself), but it's truly something that cannot be explained, only felt. \n\nPerhaps it's the way modern buildings and traditional markets sit side-by-side so comfortably. Maybe it's the experience of riding a tuk-tuk (Thai taxi) through the city while the wind whips through your hair. It could even simply be the ridiculously delicious cuisine, whether hawker-style or fine dining, that Thailand has become famed for. At any rate, vacationers to Hatyai can expect a great time even on a shoestring budget. With that said, here are 8 activities you can't miss when in Hatyai.","summary_title":null,"summary_text":null,"article_id":176582,"original_article_id":null,"language":null,"is_published_version":false,"is_more_info_allowed":null,"slug":"draft-things-to-do-hatyai-thailand","visited_period":null,"first_approved_at":"2017-08-07T18:29:00.000+08:00","published_at":"2019-03-01T17:06:00.000+08:00","created_at":"2017-07-04T10:23:45.000+08:00","updated_at":"2019-03-01T17:09:06.000+08:00","navigator_id":604,"user_id":412,"workflow_state":"published","article_type":"curated_article","content_type_new":"DG","hotel_id":null,"deleted_at":null,"region_id":6054215,"visited_month":null,"visited_season":null,"proposal":"- go shopping in Central Festival Mall (Southern Thailand's largest mall with lots of dining and shopping options)\r\n- visit the Khlong Hae Floating Market (for food and knickknacks)\r\n-visit the Hat Yai Municipal Park (2 gigantic Buddhas and an awesome view)\r\n-get a Thai massage\r\n-visit Wat Hat Yai Nai's HUGE reclining Buddha\r\n-explore Lee Garden Plaza and its surrounding areas by day and night\r\n- visit Namtok Ton Nga Chang (Elephant Tusk Falls) (seven-story waterfall you can hike up!)\r\n- have lots of fun snapping photos at the Magic Eye 3D Museum","have_good_pictures":null,"notes":null,"meta_description":"The best Hatyai has to offer, in one handy to-do article for your reference.
