As you make your way back to your hotel, you are sure to pass by at least one night market. If you're not ready to hit the lights and turn in, checking out the night markets has to be the first thing you do. The markets offer a diverse range of food, goods, and entertainment, with sizes that get so big it might seem impossible to complete.\r\n\r\nA popular, trendy night market is Talad Rot Fai (Train Market). This market has two locations, but the more central one is Talad Rot Fai in Ratchada. Stalls here line up under a blanket of bright and colorful tents selling an extensive range of food from local favorites and baked goods to more personal creations that are worth trying. Separate from all the food, you can find tents selling clothes, shoes and other merchandise like unique doggy costumes and hipster stationery. However, there is a whole other section next to the tents where vintage cars and Volkswagen vans set up shop selling vintage goods like antiques, vinyl and clothes. There is even a very gentlemen's set-up of shoe shining services. Around that area, you will find food truck cafes and bars with open-air upper decks where you can enjoy a beer with an awesome view of the bustling, vibrant market below. \r\n\r\nA similar market is part-vintage, part-flea JJ Green. Located near Chatuchak Weekend Market, JJ Green is more chilled out, comprising permanently-built shops and bars, with make-shift stalls dominating the large carpark at the back. The stores here are where you can find cheap, secondhand clothes and more collectible finds. You can find things like vinyl, old car models, artwork, vintage watches and cameras, musical instruments, and even biker-gear, all at more affordable prices than what you find elsewhere.
